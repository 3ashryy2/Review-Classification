Sentiment Analysis Project
This project focuses on sentiment analysis using machine learning techniques, particularly LinearSVC and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The dataset used in this project contains text messages with corresponding sentiment labels.

Data Exploration <a name="data-exploration"></a>
In this section, the dataset is loaded and explored to understand its structure and distribution of sentiment classes.

Data Preprocessing <a name="data-preprocessing"></a>
Text preprocessing techniques, including stop words removal and lemmatization, are applied to the text data to prepare it for machine learning algorithms.

Classification and Comparison <a name="classification-and-comparison"></a>
Two different machine learning approaches are used for sentiment analysis: LinearSVC and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The performance of these models is compared using classification reports.

Initial Experiment (LinearSVC) <a name="initial-experiment-linearsvc"></a>
The LinearSVC model is trained and evaluated on the dataset, and the best parameters are determined through grid search.

Subsequent Experiment (ANN) <a name="subsequent-experiment-ann"></a>
An ANN model is constructed and trained on the data. The model architecture includes dense layers with dropout regularization. The model is then evaluated on the test set.

Testing the saved best model <a name="testing-the-saved-best-model"></a>
The best-performing ANN model is saved and tested on new data to predict sentiment labels.
